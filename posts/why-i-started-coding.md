# Why I Started Learning to Code as a Clinician

The journey from healthcare to coding might seem unusual, but it's becoming increasingly common. Here's why I made the switch.

## The Healthcare Technology Gap

As a clinician, I often found myself frustrated with the limitations of healthcare software. The tools we use daily are often:
- Clunky and unintuitive
- Not designed with actual users in mind
- Missing features that would make our jobs easier

## The "Aha" Moment

One day, while struggling with yet another poorly designed EMR system, I realized: "I could build something better." That's when I decided to learn to code.

## The Benefits of a Clinical Background

Having a clinical background actually gives us some unique advantages in tech:
1. Deep understanding of healthcare workflows
2. First-hand experience with user pain points
3. Ability to bridge the gap between clinical and technical teams

## Getting Started

The first step was the hardest - choosing where to begin. I started with:
- Basic HTML and CSS
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Python for data analysis

## The Road Ahead

Learning to code has opened up new possibilities for improving healthcare through technology. It's not about leaving healthcare behind, but about enhancing it with new skills.
